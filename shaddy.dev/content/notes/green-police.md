> Greenwashing is a valid concern. It refers to companies falsely marketing products or practices as environmentally friendly for profit. However, thereâ€™s a significant difference between greenwashing and businesses taking genuine, albeit imperfect, steps towards sustainability. The latter deserves encouragement, not antagonism.

> We should strive to create a culture where businesses feel encouraged to make sustainable choices, even in small increments.

A [reminder](https://greenbeautycommunity.com/2024/04/green-police/) to encourage positive progress,
even if more would be possible.
I suppose this is related to the [Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/04/25/asymmetric-justice/).
We want to incentivise good things, so try to be positive about good imperfect things
or risk discouraging progress altogether.
