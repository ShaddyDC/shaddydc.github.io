Have you ever wondered about the odds of success when trying something with a 10% success probability 10 times?
Well, I guess if you seriously thought about it and spent time doing the maths, I have no news for you.
But otherwise, check out ["It's a 10% chance which I did 10 times, so it should be 100%"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pNkjHuQGDetRZypmA/it-s-a-10-chance-which-i-did-10-times-so-it-should-be-100).

And remember, don't confuse the expected value (10 times 10% should be a total of 1, right?)
with the probability of succeeding at least once (about 63%, always)!
