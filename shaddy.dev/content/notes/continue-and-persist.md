> Every day, thousands of Cease and Desist letters are issued, telling people to stop what they’re doing (Looking at you, David Chang). What a bummer!
>
> That’s why we created: The Continue and Persist Letter. A official-looking legal letter that encourages and uplifts people, one that tells people to keep doing what they’re doing! Surprise someone you appreciate by sending them a Continue and Persist Letter.

[It](https://continueandpersist.org/)'s a fun concept of course, but there are problems with
having a third party send a Serious-Looking letter to somebody you respect.  
Maybe we should just take this as an inspiration to show our appreciation more often.
Maybe just send an email to someone you're thankful to or otherwise leave them a heartfelt message.
If you want to continue going with the original idea, 
they also link a template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Um9z87Zv_zLRZRRHpii-MwmNXb3S9L6VBOeFgiqEVM/edit?tab=t.0).
