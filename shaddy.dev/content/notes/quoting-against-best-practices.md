> I have come to believe that by and large “best practices” are doing more harm than good. Not necessarily because they’re bad advice as such, but because they’re mostly pounded by either 1) various types of zealots, idiots, and assholes who abuse these kind of “best practices” as an argument from authority, or 2) inexperienced programmers who lack the ability to judge the applicability.

A reminder to think critically for yourself and question advice you hear.
Not necessarily because it's wrong, but because understanding it yields even greater benefits,
and most things are contextual.
Blindly following advice without understanding leads to cargo culting.
