I have, a while ago, started putting small tools that I developed with
LLM assistance into a tiny little website.
You can find it [here](https://shaddy.dev/tinytools)

Don't expect anything too amazing, but maybe there's something useful for you too.

In the spirit of [talking about projects](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/),
the most recent addition is a [DB Ticket Price Calculator](https://shaddy.dev/tinytools/?tool=db-price-calculator).
If you are in Germany and were thinking about whether a [Bahncard](https://int.bahn.de/en/offers/bahncard) is worth
the price for you, maybe it can be useful for you.

I have not yet automated keeping the data updated, though I did put the last data update timestamp on the site.
It is also a little scuffed, ie the U18 section looks identical to that of U26 because the additionally-available
ticket isn't caught by my categorisation, and the amount of data would probably suit itself better
to an excel sheet, but it does the job and presents some useful data in a rather simple way with little user input.

I will probably update it if I need it again.
