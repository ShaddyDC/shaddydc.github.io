> "There are the engineers who have read 1+ books on a given topic, and sometimes on *several* topics, and they all come off as extremely competent. These are, for the most part, the people that make up the audience of this blog. Of course, you do not *literally* need to read a book - a sufficiently high volume of technical blogs or courses are probably the equivalent at varying levels of efficiency - but take it for granted there is some Large Sum of information that someone has studied.
> 
> Then there are engineers (and people in every profession) who *never try for the entirety of their careers*, and this is the majority of every profession. I spoke to a reader who is employed as an extremely high-level engineer, Seth Newman - by the way, I'll connect you if you want to hire a genius data engineer in the U.S - who described the average professional as sleepwalking through their working lives, and this rung true. Of course, they are not *literally* asleep so something else is going wrong, but the description still seemed apt. There is movement - enough movement to fall down a flight of stairs - but none of the awareness needed to avoid such an outcome."

That and being somewhat discerning over what to learn and how, but that's another topic altogether.
