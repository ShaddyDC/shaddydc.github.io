description: "What irritates some good artists about the details in AI art imagery: incoherent details"

Scott Alexander quotes a friend in [an article](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-did-you-do-on-the-ai-art-turing) about
recognising AI art.
I don't see much art on social media in general, so I'm not very familiar with the topic and what to look for,
but I found this description incredibly interesting and compelling.
It makes sense that AI art would try to do details without having a coherent story to tell.

> I think part of the problem with AI art is that it produces stuff non-artists think look good but which on close inspection looks terrible, and so it ends up turning search results that used to be good into sifting through terrible stuff. Imagine if everyone got the ability to create mostly nutritional adequate meals for like five cents, but they all were mediocre rehydrated powder with way too much sucralose or artificial grape flavor or such. And your friends start inviting you over to dinner parties way more often because it's so easy to deal with food now, but practically every time, they serve you sucralose protein shake. (Maybe they do so because they were used to almost never eating food? This isn't a perfect analogy.) Furthermore, imagine people calling this the future of food and saying chefs are obsolete. You'd probably be like "wow, I'm happy that you have easy access to food you enjoy, and it is convenient for me to use sometimes, but this is kind of driving me crazy". I feel like this is relevant to artist derangement over AI art, though of course a lot of it is economic anxiety and I'm a hobbyist who doesn't feel like a temporarily embarrassed professional and thus can't relate.
