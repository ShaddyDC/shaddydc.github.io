## Hello World

Following the example of my blog [hello-world](../../posts/hello-world/), I figured I'll start with a hello world note.
I'll just post small interesting stuff I come across that doesn't warrant a full post, or quick notes.
They're roughly inspired by Simon Willison's [til](https://github.com/simonw/til),
though I'll mix it up with quotes and other stuff I find interesting.
I may or may not disentangle those in the future.
